# Disease Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a **deep learning-based disease prediction model** that analyzes medical data to predict diseases. The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, and the model was trained using a neural network to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle** and contains multiple features related to patient symptoms and medical history.
- It has been preprocessed and split into **training** and **testing** sets.

## Model
- The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- It consists of multiple layers optimized for classification tasks.
- The trained model is saved as **`disease_prediction_model.h5`**.

## Files in this Repository
- `Model.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the training and evaluation code.
- `disease_prediction_model.h5` – The trained deep learning model.
- `training_history.csv` – Training performance metrics.
- `data/Training.csv` – Training dataset.
- `data/Testing.csv` – Testing dataset.
- `README.md` – This documentation file.

## How to Run the Model
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:WahbMohamed2/Disease-Prediction-Model.git
   cd Disease-Prediction-Model
